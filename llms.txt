The CP Subsystem withstands network partitions, server failures, and client failures.
- [Manage and monitor the CP subsystem | Hazelcast Documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.7-snapshot/cp-subsystem/management): The CP Subsystem requires manual intervention while expanding or shrinking its size, or when a CP member crashes or becomes unreachable. When a CP member becomes unreachable, it is not immediately removed from the CP Subsystem because it could still be active behind a partition. By default, missing CP members are automatically removed after four hours and are replaced by other CP members if any are available.

- [Locking Maps | Hazelcast Documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.7-snapshot/data-structures/locking-maps): Although maps are thread-safe, you may prefer to have manual control over which members have access to a map entry at a given time. Hazelcast offers two ways of locking map entries: pessimistic locking and optimistic locking.
- [Managing Map Memory | Hazelcast Documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.7-snapshot/data-structures/managing-map-memory): Depending on how you use maps, they may become too large for your cluster's memory, or the data may become stale and useless to your applications. To handle these situations, you can set expiration and eviction policies.
- [Distributed Map | Hazelcast Documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.7-snapshot/data-structures/map): Distributed maps, also known as maps or IMaps, are key-value pairs that are partitioned across a cluster. Use maps to distribute data across a cluster and make it easy to scale your applications while protecting data against member failures.
- [Configuring Maps | Hazelcast Documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.7-snapshot/data-structures/map-config): Map configuration is part of the overall Hazelcast server configuration. When you create your map, it inherits the configuration that is set up on the server.

- [Reading Map Metrics | Hazelcast Documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.7-snapshot/data-structures/reading-map-metrics): By default, you can read metrics for a given map, such as the primary and backup entry count, last update time, and locked entry count on each member of your cluster. You can access these statistics for the entire map, for the map entries on a specific cluster member, or specific map entries.

When data is moved either between a client and the Hazelcast cluster or between cluster members, it is always in serialized (binary) format. Depending on your use case, it may be more efficient to store the data in that serialized format, either on-heap or off-heap, or deserialize it back to the original object format.

The CP Subsystem withstands network partitions, server failures, and client failures.
- [Manage and monitor the CP subsystem | Hazelcast Documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.6/cp-subsystem/management): The CP Subsystem requires manual intervention while expanding or shrinking its size, or when a CP member crashes or becomes unreachable. When a CP member becomes unreachable, it is not immediately removed from the CP Subsystem because it could still be active behind a partition. By default, missing CP members are automatically removed after four hours and are replaced by other CP members if any are available.
- [Migrate Raft log files | Hazelcast Documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.6/cp-subsystem/raft-log-file-exporter): The RaftLogFileExporter is a tool that helps migrate persisted CP state between different Hazelcast versions.

You can use these events to trigger execution of code, or even intercept the event and change it before it affects the data in memory.
- [Locking Maps | Hazelcast Documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.6/data-structures/locking-maps): Although maps are thread-safe, you may prefer to have manual control over which members have access to a map entry at a given time. Hazelcast offers two ways of locking map entries: pessimistic locking and optimistic locking.
- [Managing Map Memory | Hazelcast Documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.6/data-structures/managing-map-memory): Depending on how you use maps, they may become too large for your cluster's memory, or the data may become stale and useless to your applications. To handle these situations, you can set expiration and eviction policies.
- [Distributed Map | Hazelcast Documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.6/data-structures/map): Distributed maps, also known as maps or IMaps, are key-value pairs that are partitioned across a cluster. Use maps to distribute data across a cluster and make it easy to scale your applications while protecting data against member failures.
- [Configuring Maps | Hazelcast Documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.6/data-structures/map-config): Map configuration is part of the overall Hazelcast server configuration. When you create your map, it inherits the configuration that is set up on the server. It is important to plan your map configuration ahead of time, as you cannot change the configuration of a map once it is created without restarting your entire cluster.

- [Reading Map Metrics | Hazelcast Documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.6/data-structures/reading-map-metrics): By default, you can read metrics for a given map, such as the primary and backup entry count, last update time, and locked entry count on each member of your cluster. You can access these statistics for the entire map, for the map entries on a specific cluster member, or specific map entries.

When data is moved either between a client and the Hazelcast cluster or between cluster members, it is always in serialized (binary) format. Depending on your use case, it may be more efficient to store the data in that serialized format, either on-heap or off-heap, or deserialize it back to the original object format.

- [CP Subsystem | Hazelcast Documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.5/cp-subsystem/cp-subsystem): CP Subsystem is a component of a Hazelcast cluster that builds a strongly consistent layer for a set of distributed data structures. As well as network partitions, the CP Subsystem withstands server and client failures.
- [Managing and Monitoring the CP Subsystem | Hazelcast Documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.5/cp-subsystem/management): The CP Subsystem requires manual intervention while expanding or shrinking its size, or when a CP member crashes or becomes unreachable. When a CP member becomes unreachable, it is not automatically removed from CP Subsystem because it could still be active and partitioned away.

You can use these events to trigger execution of code, or even intercept the event and change it before it affects the data in memory.
- [Locking Maps | Hazelcast Documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.5/data-structures/locking-maps): Although maps are thread-safe, you may prefer to have manual control over which members have access to a map entry at a given time. Hazelcast offers two ways of locking map entries: pessimistic locking and optimistic locking.
- [Managing Map Memory | Hazelcast Documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.5/data-structures/managing-map-memory): Depending on how you use maps, they may become too large for your cluster's memory, or the data may become stale and useless to your applications. To handle these situations, you can set expiration and eviction policies.
- [Distributed Map | Hazelcast Documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.5/data-structures/map): Distributed maps, also known as maps or IMaps, are key-value pairs that are partitioned across a cluster. Use maps to distribute data across a cluster and make it easy to scale your applications while protecting data against member failures.
- [Configuring Maps | Hazelcast Documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.5/data-structures/map-config): Map configuration is part of the overall Hazelcast server configuration. When you create your map, it inherits the configuration that is set up on the server. It is important to plan your map configuration ahead of time, as you cannot change the configuration of a map once it is created without restarting your entire cluster.

When data is moved either between a client and the Hazelcast cluster or between cluster members, it is always in serialized (binary) format. Depending on your use case, it may be more efficient to store the data in that serialized format, either on-heap or off-heap, or deserialize it back to the original object format.
