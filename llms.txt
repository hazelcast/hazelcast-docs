# Hazelcast Platform Documentation

> Hazelcast is a unified real-time data platform combining stream processing with a fast data store for consistently low-latency querying, aggregation, and stateful computation against event streams and traditional data sources.

Hazelcast enables you to build resource-efficient, real-time applications with distributed data structures, SQL querying, stream processing via Jet, and clustering capabilities. Deploy at any scale from edge devices to large cloud clusters.

**Community Edition**: Open source under Apache 2.0 license with core in-memory data grid and stream processing features.  
**Enterprise Edition**: Advanced features including CP Subsystem for strong consistency, WAN Replication, Security, Vector Search, High-Density Memory, and commercial support.

Current version: 5.7
