This repository hosts an {url-antora}[Antora] playbook project for the Hazelcast documentation site.

== Introduction to Antora

Antora is a static site generator that facilitates a docs-as-code workflow.

In Antora, documentation is stored in Git repositories and processed to output a static website.

Documentation can be stored in one or more repositories, using either branches or tags to version it.

Antora uses Asciidoctor.js to convert Asciidoc to HTML, then it uses Handlebars to set that HTML into a page layout.

NOTE: The page layouts and UI code (css, JavaScript, Handlebars templates) are stored in a {url-docs-ui}[separate repository], which outputs a `ui-bundle.zip` file that this project references in the playbook.

TIP: Learn more about Antora with this excellent link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAJ8F7yQz64&t=4s[introduction on YouTube].

== The Playbook

The playbook defines the content sources (repositories and branches), site URL, UI bundle URL, global AsciiDoc attributes, and Asciidoctor extensions.

This project has two playbook files, which configure the build process for the documentation site:

- `antora-playbook-local.yml`: link:{url-contributing}#local-builds[For local builds]
- `antora-playbook.yml`: For production builds (used by our hosting provider link:{url-netlify}[Netlify])

== Documentation Content

Source content for the documentation site is marked up in link:{url-asciidoc}[Asciidoc].

The current playbooks pull content from the following repositories:

- link:{url-hz-docs}[Platform documentation]
- link:{url-cloud-docs}[Cloud documentation]
- link:{url-imdg-docs}[IMDG documentation]
- link:{url-k8-docs}[Platform Operator documentation]
- link:{url-mc-docs}[Management Center documentation]

Inside these repositories, content may be stored in the following:

- `master/main` branch: The `latest-dev` content, which represents the current development version of the product
- `archived-versions` branch: Legacy content that is not hosted on Antora, but instead given a single page with a link to the legacy documentation site
- Branches prefixed with `v/`: Versioned releases

NOTE: To learn about release workflows, see the README of a content repository.

[[home]]
== Home Component

The `home/` directory in this repository contains the Home documentation component. The source code for the home page is in the `body-home.hbs` template of the link:{url-docs-ui}[`hazelcast-docs-ui` repository].

image::images/home-page.png[Preview of the home page]

== Tutorials Component

The `tutorials/` directory in this repository contains the Tutorials documentation component. The source code for the tutorials subsite is in the `tutorials-*.hbs` templates of the link:{url-docs-ui}[`hazelcast-docs-ui` repository].

For information about contributing new tutorials, see link:https://github.com/hazelcast-guides/base-guide/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.adoc[Tutorial Templates]

== Custom Asciidoctor Extensions

The custom extension in the `lib/` directory processes the Asciidoc `tabs` blocks to generate tabbed code samples in the output HTML.

For more information about writing Asciidoctor.js extensions, see the {url-asciidoc-extensions}[Asciidoctor docs].

== Production and Staging Sites

The documentation site is hosted on link:{url-netlify}[Netlify], which builds two versions of the site from this GitHub repository:

- link:{url-production}[Production site]: This site is hosted on {url-production} and is built from the `main` branch
- link:{url-staging}[Staging site]: This site is hosted on {url-staging} and is built from the `develop` branch

To preview changes, all pull requests are made to the `develop` branch. When the team are happy with the changes, the `develop` branch is merged into the `main` branch to deploy the changes to the production site.

== Redirects

To make it easy for users to find and bookmark the latest content, we use the following aliases:

- `latest`: The latest stable version.
- `latest-dev`: The latest development version.

These aliases are configured in the `_redirects` file, which Netlify uses to redirect to their actual versioned content.

For details about this file, see the link:{url-netlify-docs}/routing/redirects/redirect-options[Netlify documentation].

== Search

The search bar in the documentation is powered by an link:{url-algolia}[Algolia] search index.

Once a day, we use a link:{url-github-docsearch-scraper}[DocSearch scraper] to index the site, using a <<github-actions, GitHub Action>>, and to send that index to Algolia.

To index the documentation, DocSearch uses our `search-config.json` file. For more information about search configuration, see the link:{url-docsearch}/config-file[DocSearch documentation].

== Generating PDFs

You can generate a PDF of the following documentation:

- Hazelcast Platform version 5.0
- Hazelcast Platform version 5.1

To generate PDFs, you'll need the following prerequisites:

- At least Ruby 2.7
- Node.js 16, preferably using nvm for the install
- Make sure that the PATH environment variable includes both Ruby and Node

To generate the PDFs, do the following in the root of this repository:

. Install the dependencies.
+
```bash
npm i
```

. Install Asciidoctor PDF.
+
```bash
bundle --path=.bundle/gems
```
NOTE: On Windows, you may need to replace the forward slash in the `--path` value with a backslash (i.e., `--path=.bundle\gems`).

. Execute a script to generate the PDFs for a version of the documentation.
+
```bash
npm run-script generate-pdfs-platform-5-1
```

This script generates a PDF for the Hazelcast Platform 5.1 documentation.

The result of this script is a `pdf-docs` directory, in which the artifacts for the PDF files are assembled and the PDF files are generated.

Some errors are displayed in the output, but you can ignore them.

- Management Center links are broken: Since the script builds only a PDF of the Platform documentation, it's normal that these links are broken.

- `null startLine`: The script uses the link:https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-assembler/-/blob/main/README.adoc[Antora assembler extension], which is in an alpha state. These errors are generated from the PDF converter. The output does not appear to be broken, so you can ignore this type of error.

We will track the status of the extension and update it when new releases are available.

== Links Checker

=== History
Previously each branch of each repo had its own `check-links-playbook.yml` for links-checker. The problem was, that for the correct links check `check-links-playbook.yml` should have contained the full list of all other repos and branches that have targets of the links from the current branch, and all repos and branches that have links TO the current branch. In other words - that file was complicated to maintain, so no one did, resulting in a wrong link check with many false negatives and positives.

=== Idea
We do care about broken links only in the context of the full production build. That's why the only correct way to check links is using global link:https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-docs/blob/main/antora-playbook.yml[`antora-playbook.yml`].

=== How it works now
The links checker workflow consists of the next steps:

. Check out the global `antora-playbook.yml`.
. Check out the local `antora-playbook.yml`.
. Modify `content.sources` from the global `antora-playbook.yml` (use correct syntax for current PR branch).
. Inject `content.sources` from the global `antora-playbook.yml` to the local one (for links check we need only that list, but we cannot reuse the whole global `antora-playbook.yml`, because it might contain some extensions or parts not runnable in the context of a docs repo).
. Run the links check and report the results.

For this to happen we have several common files in the link:https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-docs[hazelcast-docs repo]

.Files for links checker
[cols="m,a"]
|===
|File |Description

|link:https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-docs/blob/main/.github/actions/validate/action.yml[action.yml]
|Contains common parts of the links checker workflow

|link:https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-docs-tools/blob/v1.0.0/scripts/check-links-playbook-loader.js[load-check-links-playbook.js]
|Responsible for modification of `content.sources` from the global `antora-playbook.yml`.
|===

Each of the docs repos can just call the common validate action from its workflow.

== GitHub Actions

To automate some elements of the build process, this repository includes the following GitHub Actions:

.GitHub Actions
[cols="m,a,a"]
|===
|File |Description |Triggers

|index-site.yml
|Runs the link:{url-github-docsearch-scraper}[DocSearch scraper] in a Docker container to index the site and send the index to Algolia
|1st and 15th of every month at 00:00 UTC

NOTE: We used to run this once per day, but it was causing overage charges. The crawler that we use uploads a temporary index before deleting the old one. This causes us to go over our limit more than three days in a month, which is the grace period that Algolia provides.

|publish-to-production.yml
|Merges the `develop` branch into the `main` branch to publish changes on the staging site to production.
|Manual
|===

As well as these actions, content repositories that are listed under the `content.sources` field in the `antora-playbook.yml` file also include GitHub actions to trigger builds of the production site.

```yaml
content:
  sources:
  - url: https://github.com/hazelcast/imdg-docs
    branches: [master]
    start_path: docs
```

Whenever content in the repository's listed branches are changed, the GitHub Action sends a link:{url-netlify-docs}/configure-builds/build-hooks/[build hook] to Netlify to trigger a new build of the staging site.

For an example of these GitHub Actions, see the link:{url-imdg-docs}[IMDG documentation repository].
