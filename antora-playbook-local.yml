      #    These are private repos. You need to do private repository authentication.
      #    See [here](https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/playbook/private-repository-auth/) how to do that
      #    The easiest way is to use a GitHub token like https://{TOKEN}:@github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-mono
